Like with most sites with feeds, your eye is mostly drawn to the elements in that feed. And because we know people like visuals, we specifically lead our posts with an image. After that, you may be led to the sidebar where our most Popular posts and Giveaways are lists, because, who doesn’t like free stuff?

I’m thankful for the opportunity to analyze the EDMTunes site as, maybe after Dev Bootcamp, I can help to revamp the pain points I identify now! Visually, our site is basic, plain, static, messy on top, and simple (sorry, editors!). But to our defense, our functionality is straightforward as well: to provide EDM news, amass sets, and garner social media interaction. It’s practical, informative, and gets people the music they want – so there isn’t a huge disjunction between visual and functional characteristics, though there’s much room for improvement.

Like with FastCompany, if readers are looking for the latest content, the feed provides that very well. Our navigation bar above facilitates searching content by topic, while the search bar allows for specific searches – but I suggest using Google with “EDMTunes ____” instead for better results
