	<h2>Thinking About The Way You Think</h2>

	<p>I'm not going to lie - the first two weeks of prep have been a struggle, and I hear it doesn't get any easier. So if you can't beat em'...learn to deal with em! Here are my biggest challenges:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Managing my time due to full-time work commitments and - more specifically - the time I spend on DBC material efficiently.</li>
	<li>Organizing of all the required elements and tasks at hand each week.</li>
	<li>Maintaining focus for a sufficient amount of time and not getting distracted.</li>
	<li>Trying to work through problems without prematurely feeling tempted to look at the answer.</li>
	<li>Again, feeling pressured for time and trying to 'be impressive' at the same time.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Whether it is my thinking style, lifestyle, or personality that catalyze my struggles, my best answer is probably - a cocktail of all three. For example, lifestyle-wise, I'm addicted to SoundCloud and TweetDeck; these are probably not the best means of focus when trying to code. Personality-wise, I'm an avid conversationalist. I love texting, messaging, chatting, etc. and this also is a hindrance to my focus. But what about my thinking style? I donâ€™t want to blame everything on myself :).</p>

	<p>As a chimera between an 'Abstract Random' and 'Concrete Random' thinker, I can't help but to feel that all my obscure thoughts of filling the Grand Canyon with Jell-o and inventing a giant vacuum that could suck up all my stuff when I move are substantiated. Well, sort of.</p>

	<p>According to this<a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm"> article</a>, 'Random' in pertinence to thinking is &quot;organizing information in chunks and in no particular order&quot; and often means &quot;skipping steps in a procedure and still producing the desired results,&quot; maybe starting in the middle or even working backwards.</p>

	<p>Ok, so my Jell-O and vacuum thoughts still hold no base regarding my thinking style, but I can definitely shake my head 'yes to the statements above.</p>

	<p>As some of the characteristics conflict - such as 'Concrete Random' preferring independent work and 'Abstract Random' striving in groups, I picked-and-chose between the two characteristics to kind of come up with a personalized &quot;Michelle Thinking Style.&quot; But like the duality suggest, sometimes I waver between two preferences and can't tell if I work better independently or in groups. The yellow dots notate some of characteristics I can relate to most strongly:</p>

	<h4>So the question is, knowing all this. what can I do about it?</h4>

	<p>To address my struggles - whether learning, lifestyle, or personality-related, I have some steps I take to better focus and make use of my learning time:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Using the Pomodoro technique - shutting down my social media and putting my phone away during my focus times.</li>
		<li>Having expectations set before pairing sessions so I can prepare and experiment independently, then use the session to corroborate or enhance my knowledge.</li>
		<li>Keeping a checklist of all the week's activities and crossing each one off to see my progress and keep things organized.</li>
		<li>Find some peace by taking time to view other's work so I can gauge where I am and levelset myself with the pace of the group. Seeing competition in a motivating way, not as a way to &quot;beat&quot; others.</li>
	</ul>
