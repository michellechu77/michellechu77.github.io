  <h2>How Do I Ask a 'Good' Technical Question? (That Wasn't One)</h2>

  <p>In my 9 Weeks of prep, I've realized a few things:
    <ul>
      <li>A lot of my time is spent Google-ing technical questions and reading posts on StackOverflow to resolve my problems.</li>
      <li>Phrasing question effectively for a Google search is an art.</li>
      <li>Most - if not all - my questions have been previously asked by someone else.</li>
    </ul>
   The programming community is an immensely gumptious, collaborative one with a wonderful knack for providing free resources and help, so here are some tips to drawing the most value from your questions!</p>

   <h3>Do Thorough Pre-search Before Posing a Question</h3>
   <p>As noted in my third statement above, many questions you'll have, or those similar, (especially as a beginner) will have been asked and answered already. <b>Be thorough in your pre-search before you pose a question. </b> Not only will you get a faster response to your question, but you'll save others' from wasting their time from your redundancy.</p>

   <h3>Use an Informative Title that Summarizes The Question</h3>
   <p>Like a headline of an article or title to a book, the title to your post is crucial to catching peoples' attention and providing enough information for them to make the initial decision of if they can help or not. Think of it as the subject of an important email or a tweet - <b>how can you most concisely identify your problem and facilitate its resolution?</b> StackOverflow provides some examples of good and bad titles:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bad: C# Math Confusion</li>
      <li>Good: Why does using float instead of int give me different results when all of my inputs are integers?</li>
      <li>Bad: [php] session doubt</li>
      <li>Good: How can I redirect users to different pages based on session data in PHP?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Provide an 'Executive Summary' of Your Problem</h3>
    <p>If the title is like the headline of an article, you want to provide basic context and a summary of the critical facts next. Include information such as language version, platform, operating system, and what software you are using. Describe what the intended outcome is, what approaches you have tried, and why/how those approaches have failed. Be as detailed as possible! Remember, these people have zero knowledge of your work prior to reading the post.</p>

    <h3>Help Reproduce Your Problem (With Code)</h3>
    <p>Code may or may not be necessary to help others replicate your problem, but experiencing the issues firsthand can be valuable for others. <b>If you're going to provide code, it should be standalone and complete.</b> Don't post 100s of lines of code, only the snippets which are relevant, but include enough code for your problem stated in the executive summary to be reproducible by others. Typically, your code snippet shouldn't interact with a database, unless it's a database question.</p>

    <h3>Make Your Post Error-Free and Easy-to-Read</h3>
    <p>Your issue is probably challenging enough, don't add more complexity with simple mistakes. Proof read your post for spelling and grammar errors, and try reading it with an 'oblivious mind' - as if you're encountering the problem for the first time - and see if the story provided is clear. Lastly, make sure your post is formatted clearly into paragraphs and snippets of code.</p>

    <h3>Provide Feedback to Responses</h3>
    <p><b>Remember: Others are taking the time to help YOU.</b> Don't post a question and fail to engage with the people that are taking the time to help you. If someone asks for further explanation, provide the necessary clarification by editing your post. If someone gives an answer that doesn't quite solve your problem, respectfully respond as to why it doesn't address your issue and review your post to provide more elucidating guidance.</p>
