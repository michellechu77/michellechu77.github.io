		<h2>Will Javascript Win the Web Development Popularity Contest?</h2>

		<div class="wrapper">

		</div>

		<p>In regards to web development, Javascript seems to be a top contender in the popularity contest of programming languages. In 'Top Wonders of the World' and 'Things that are Better than Sleeping'? Not so much. But then again, there are few things better than a scrumptiously deep sleep.</p>
		<p>For Homecoming nominations and other popularity contests of the sort, the source of information is usually gathered directly from the people - so to address the question 'Why is Javascript so popular in web development,' I sought it appropriate to predominantly consult Quora to get answers from real people with firsthand experience.</p>

		<h4>Why Javascript is the "Language of the Web"</h4>

		<ul>
			<li><b>People claim Javascript is easy to learn.</b> With Javascript, it's possible to create tangible projects within minutes because the languages integrates with HTML, works with any OS or computer, requires no complicated setup, and no special software.</li><br>
			<li><b>Supported my all main browsers.</b> Javascript is embedded in all major browsers and is widely used; 92% of sites on the web use Javascript!</li><br>
			<li><b>Enables client-side scripting.</b> With Javscript, programmers can code dynamic browser behaviors and user interfaces by running scripts on your computer after loading a webpage. This is especially helpful in a culture where users are demanding of seamless user experiences from an increasingly diverse array of devices.</li><br>
			<li><b>Also enables server-side scripting.</b> With node.js you don't need other language (php,java) for server-side code.Server-side languages run script before the HTML is loaded and on the server which hosts the HTML code, sending the HTML to your computer. Server-side scripting is mainly used for pulling data from servers.</li><br>
			<li><b>Is quick and responsive.</b> Javascript is very efficient because it communicates well with the server, which means quicker processes for the end user. Because it uses a DOM Concept, most everything is done on the client-side which is very faster than server-side processing.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Though this covers just the tip of the iceberg with Javascript, and it's clear as to why Javascript's benefits and popularity go hand-in-hand. Not only is Javascript widespread, versatile, and convenient to use, it has a wide range of functionalities such as:

		<ul>
			<li><b>Integrating well with HTML.</b> Javascript can be inserted in small "snippets" directly into HTML pages, and can read, write, and modify HTML element</li><br>
			<li><b>Allowing reactive events.</b> You can trigger actions or events with Javascript, such as after a page has loaded or when a user clicks on an HTML element</li><br>
			<li><b>Validating data.</b> Javascript can validate form data before it is submitted to a server. This saves the server from extra processing.</li><br>
			<li><b>Detecting visitors' browser.</b> This allows you to load customized pages or elements according to different browsers.</li><br>
			<li><b>Creating cookies.</b> Javascript can store and retrieve information on the visitor's computer.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Now, now, we know nothing is perfect, and like everything else, Javascript has its limitations, many of which are caused by Javascript's tendency to run on the browser as opposed to running on the server, and security restrictions. Because Javascript executes code on the user's computer, it can be exploited for malicious purposes. Javascript-intensive pages are also not very search engine-friendly, as the content is made unreadable for bots. Javascript cannot access databases without the supplement of Ajax and server-side scripts and cannot read or write files as it's not allowed to access anything outside of the webpage itself.</p>

		<p>It looks like Javascript has potential to be the Queen of Web Development in the future, but only time will tell!</p>
