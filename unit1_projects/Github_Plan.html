<h1>Wireframing My Site</h1>
<h3>Create a Plan for your Web Page:</h3>
<p>My github site will be incrementally evolving, so it's a bit difficult to design, as I don't know it's ultimate use nor all the content that will be on the page. As of now, I plan to design it simply - build a solid base to where I can add and adapt my content later. I like sites that are are clean, simple, and visual. I plan on using a photo as the background of the page, as I've seen a lot of websites do this recently, and bold, white text over this background image. I'll have my name as a header, and a little 'tagline' introduction and title to the blog underneath. Also, I will have a navigation bar at the top to link to my assignments, technical blog posts, and cultural blog posts. Lastly, I would like to add links to my social media pages at the footer of the page.</p>
