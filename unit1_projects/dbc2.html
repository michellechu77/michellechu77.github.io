				<p>I am by no means the most fanatical festival goer or the most sagacious veteran of festivals - heck, I forgot my sleeping bag to the last one I went to. But music, and the irreplicable, life-changing experience that festivals provide is undoubtedly one of the most exhilirating discoveries in my life, and I want...NEED to share it with everyone. </p>
				<br>
				<p>Beyond the cliche, I truly love collecting experiences and, believe me, the insanity that is music festivals is an incredible breeding grounds for the most unique, memorable, and unexpected experiences of your life.</p>
				<br>
				<p>This cursory page is not a means to boast about "all my crazy adventures" or to tell you that this is what you need to do. I've made many of mistakes and learned that many more lessons, and in permeating my tips, I can only hope for one of the following:</p>
				<br>
				<ol id="lists">
					<li>Your festival experiences may be enhanced</li>
					<li>You may be persuaded to attend your first festival</li>
					<li>You can see that I can create a primitive, yet informational webpage.</li>
				</ol>
			</p>

			<h3>Festivals In General</h3>
			<ul>
				<li> Stay hydrated, stay hydrated, stay hydrated! Invest in a Camelbak or spend the $5 on water to avoid a $1000 hospital bill when you pass out from dehydration. </li> 
				<br>
				<li> If you're in a group - bring a totem! This can be a flag, an inflatable toy, or basically anything you stick on a tall pole and see over the crowd. </li>
				<br>
				<li> Check out artists you don't know. I've discovered some of my - now - favorite artists just by stumbling onto their set. </li>
				<br>
				<li> Bring positive vibes. It's a festival - people ARE going to step on your feet, walk through you in the crowd, and accidentally spill their beer on you. Smile and move on. </li>
				<br>
				<li> Be creative and express yourself! If that means dressing up as a dinosaur, go for it. If that means interpretive dancing to the music, great. </li>
				<br>
				<li> Relax and take naps. Dancing around for 8+ hours is draining. Don't feel bad if you need to find some shade and take a nap, or sit down for a set. </li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Camping Festival</h3>
			<ul>
				<li> Unless it's in the winter, plan on waking up at 8AM to yourself baking in your tent. Either bring a fan, or find some shade in the morning to continue your sleep. </li>
				<br>
				<li> Showers are limited, the porta-potties will be gross, and your standard of hygiene will decreases dramatically, so bring lots of baby wipes! </li>
				<br>
				<li> Continuing with hygiene, you are bound to be smelly. Be nice to your tent mate and bring some car air freshners to hang in your tent! </li>
				<br>
				<li> Food may not be ready excessible or expensive, bring lots of energy-packed foods such as granola bars, trail mix, fruit, and crackers. <li>
				<br>
				<li> Make friends with your camping neighbors. Whether you invite them to sit with you or offer a beer, you never know when you need to borrow something from them or how cool they'll be. </li>
				<br>
				<li> Invest in a external battery to charge your phone. You don't want to run your car to charge your phone, and you don't want it to die in case of emergencies. </li> 
			</ul>
